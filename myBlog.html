		<p class="first">They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.</p>
		
		<p>Eliptical talk. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Stay focused. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Don’t ever play yourself. Lion! The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed.</p>
		
		<p>Lion! Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. I’m up to something. How’s business? Boomin. I’m up to something. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Cloth talk.</p>

		<h2>this is another article</h2>

		<p class="first">Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

		<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
